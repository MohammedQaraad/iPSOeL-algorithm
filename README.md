ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) poses a significant public health challenge globally, necessitating effective prevention and risk assessment strategies. This paper presents iPSOeL, an optimized Particle Swarm Optimization variant tailored for fine-tuning XGBoost hyperparameters. By integrating rank-based updates and the logistic map, iPSOeL enhances eLEO performance within PSO. Evaluation against state-of-the-art methods demonstrates iPSOeL's superior reliability, accuracy, and convergence speed. iPSOeL-XGBoost optimizes XGBoost, a machine learning method, by fine-tuning its hyperparameters, achieving notable predictive performance. The iPSOeL-XGBoost demonstrates impressive predictive performance, achieving notable metrics including a 93% F1 score, 94% recall, 93% accuracy, and a 92% area under the ROC curve. Additionally, generalized across diverse datasets, iPSOeL showcases adaptability and robustness and offers clinicians a valuable tool for evaluating patient CVD risks.
